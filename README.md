## Inspiration

Surplus is an application that prevents restaurants from losing money due to food waste and focuses on high food insecurity rates amongst college students. **1 in 4 college students go hungry every night across the United States. Restaurants will post leftovers on our application that would otherwise be thrown away at a discounted price.** Students will be notified that a local restaurant is offering a special deal and have the opportunity to pay a lesser price for a meal while restaurants can make extra money. Restaurants are able to make some of their money back, students can grab a discounted meal — food doesn’t end up in the trash and students have the opportunity to have a meal.
