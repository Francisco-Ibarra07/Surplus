## Inspiration

Surplus is an application that prevents restaurants from losing money due to food waste and focuses on high food insecurity rates amongst college students. **1 in 4 college students go hungry every night across the United States. Restaurants will post leftovers on our application that would otherwise be thrown away at a discounted price.** Students will be notified that a local restaurant is offering a special deal and have the opportunity to pay a lesser price for a meal while restaurants can make extra money. Restaurants are able to make some of their money back, students can grab a discounted meal — food doesn’t end up in the trash and students have the opportunity to have a meal.

## External Tools

1. Adobe Xd
We used Adobe XD for wireframing and high fidelity mockups. It is important to have         wireframe because we don’t want to code blindly. Also, it is easier to make edits on here         than after coding.

2. Firebase Database
Firebase was our main database that was used.
